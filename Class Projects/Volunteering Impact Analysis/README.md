# Volunteering Impact Analysis

## Project Overview
UCLA students were surveyed and asked to choose one volunteer activity they pursued during the 2022-23 academic year and describe it. Survey respondents answered both multiple choice and short answer questions about their volunteer experiences. For this project, we aimed to use the text-based responses of the survey to answer two questions - what impact the volunteering activity had on students, and whether the impact was related to their motivation for participating, the way students found out about the volunteer opportunity, and the setting of the activity.

## Methodology
Client data is private and therefore not provided. For our analysis, we focused on text analysis. We used bi-gram and tri-gram analysis to look at the specific word-choice of students, and created word cloud of words students used to describe their feelings while volunteering to determine impact on students. Sentiment analysis was also performed using the NRC text lexicon. Finally, we used ANOVA to investigate potential mean differences related to the analyzed factors.

## Results
From analyzing the bi-grams, the impact of volunteering appears to be related to the population served, specifically with those who served high school students, patients, or those with food insecurity feeling a larger impact. We also learned that many students described feeling good or happy while volunteering. Through tri-gram analysis we were also able to learn that many students were able to learn or realize something new and volunteering also helped some students make decisions about their future volunteering or their careers.

Sentiment analysis shows that in general, volunteering is ultimately a positive experience for students, as positive sentiments and emotions consistently far outnumber the negative ones. Regardless of what motive or setting or how a student found out about the volunteering activity, this pattern holds, with trust, joy, and anticipation being the most common emotions.
